Due to the rapid increase of vehicles on the road, the probability of road 
accidents is rising steeply. Drunk driving is considered to be a major cause of 
road accidents throughout the world. The main aim of this project is to develop 
a system that would detect the amount of alcohol consumed by the driver. 
When the alcohol sensor detects the presence of alcohol in a person, the vehicle 
engine is turned off, and the emergency siren is blown as soon as alcohol is 
detected. Therefore, loss of life and property is avoided. An alcohol sensor is 
installed on the steering wheel of the car. The engine only starts when the driver 
blows on the sensor, and the Arduino always uses the alcohol sensor 
information to check for drunk driving. The proposed system aims to prevent 
the user from driving while drunk, thereby reducing the number of accidents 
occurring due to drunk driving. The proposed model is developed using an 
Arduino Uno and an alcohol detection sensor (MQ-3) as its major components. 
When the level of alcohol crosses a permissible limit, the vehicle ignition system 
(DC motor) will be turned off.
